% The Abstract Page

\begin{abstract}
Outflows are ubiquitous in accreting systems across 10 orders of magnitude in mass. 
They can take the form of highly collimated radio jets, or less collimated, mass loaded
winds emanating from the accretion disc. Perhaps the most spectacular evidence
for accretion disc winds is the blue-shifted, broad absorption lines (BALs) in UV resonance
lines, seen in cataclysmic variables (CVs) and approximately $20\%$ of quasars. In addition to 
directly producing absorption in the spectrum, it is possible that accretion disc winds
may significantly affect the line and continuum {\em emission} from CVs and quasars -- as a result,
they may even dominate the spectral appearance of such objects. When one considers that
disc winds are also a possible mechanism for AGN feedback, it becomes clear that understanding
the physics and true spectral imprint of these winds is of
wide-ranging astrophysical significance.

In this thesis I use the confusingly named Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) code, \py, 
to conduct a series of MCRT and photoionization simulations designed to test
simple biconical disc wind models. I provide a detailed description of
these methods, focusing particularly on the macro-atom implementation developed by Leon Lucy.
First, I apply them to the optical spectra of CVs. 
Second, I conduct tests of quasar unification models. 
Finally, informed by the previous study, I use Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Hubble Space 
Telescope data to test the models in an empirical way, by using emission line equivalent widths
as a probe of unification geometries.

Overall, the work presented here suggests that {\em disc winds matter}. 
They not only act as a spectral `filter' for the underlying
accretion continuum, but may actually dominate the emergent spectrum from accreting objects.
As a result, unveiling their driving mechanisms, mass-loss rates, and ionization structure
is an important goal for the astronomical community.
