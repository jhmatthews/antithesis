Outflows are ubiquitous in accreting systems across 10 orders of magnitude in mass. 
They can take the form of highly collimated radio jets, or less collimated, mass loaded
winds emanating from the accretion disc. Perhaps the most spectacular evidence
for accretion disc winds is the blue-shifted, broad absorption lines (BALs) in UV resonance
lines, seen in cataclysmic variables (CVs) and approximately $20\%$ of quasars. In addition to 
directly producing absorption in the spectrum, it is possible that accretion disc winds
may significantly affect the line and continuum {\em emission} from CVs and quasars -- as a result,
they may even dominate the spectral appearance of such objects. When one considers that
disc winds are also a possible mechanism for AGN feedback, it becomes clear that understanding
the physics and true spectral imprint of these winds is of wide-ranging astrophysical significance.

In this thesis I use the confusingly named Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) code, \py, 
to conduct a series of MCRT and photoionization simulations designed to test
simple biconical disc wind models. I provide a detailed description of
these methods, focusing particularly on the macro-atom implementation developed by Leon Lucy.
First, I apply them to the optical spectra of CVs. 
Second, I conduct tests of quasar unification models. 
Finally, informed by the previous study, I use Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Hubble Space 
Telescope data to test the models in an empirical way, by using emission line equivalent widths
as a probe of unification geometries.

Overall, the work presented here suggests that {\em disc winds matter}. 
They not only act as a spectral `filter' for the underlying
accretion continuum, but may actually dominate the emergent spectrum from accreting objects.
As a result, unveiling their driving mechanisms, mass-loss rates, and ionization structure
is an important goal for the astronomical community.

% First and foremost, I would like to thank Christian Knigge, for being
% such an enthusiastic, helpful and stimulating supervisor throughout my PhD. 
% Christian, I {\em always} left our meetings more positive than before -- that speaks
% volumes -- and I greatly enjoyed our conversations about science,
% Explosions in the Sky and Japanese whisky. Especially when they were in New York.
% I am also extremely grateful to Knox Long
% for all his help and advice, writing the majority of the code and sharing some
% of his astronomy knowledge
% with me, and Stuart `radiative transfer guru' Sim for being always correct
% and immensely helpful, especially when it came to understanding macro-atoms.
% I would also like to thank Nick Higginbottom for hours upon hours of assistance
% and friendship. Nick, I think we make a great team, and I am really grateful for
% all the time you put in teaching me the ropes, 
% particularly near the start of my PhD.
% To all of the above people; thankyou for being part of a collaboration that
% did some great science, but also knew when to discuss a disastrous 
% code bug with a knowing smile and ironic joke. In some ways, our group
% is best summed up by the fact that we work on a code called Python!

% % I would also like to thank Daniel Proga, Sebastien Hoenig,
% % Poshak Gandhi, Francesco Shankar, Diego Altamirano, 


% Apart from those who I worked with, I would like to thank 
% everyone who helped make Southampton a happy place to be over 3+ years.
% There are too many to name, but I will indulge a few. To Sam Connolly -- thanks 
% for being a true friend for what is now a lot of years. You have been an ever-present
% and someone who I can always rely on for good beer, music and knowing looks.
% Sadie Jones -- you were there when I needed you most for a cwtch, and I really am 
% incredibly grateful for that. I probably should tell you that more.
% Rob Firth -- my gym buddy and best punner. Aarran Shaw -- perpetually first
% and Juan Venancio Hernandez Santisteban -- telepathic football partner
% and legend of a house and office mate. Thankyou to all of you.
% I would also like to thank Richard Latouche for all the gains and just being a generally
% great housemate. 

% There are also many people, outside of Southampton, who I must thank.
% Most of all, Mum, Dad, Beth and Nick, and the rest of my family. Thanks
% for supporting me throughout my studies and just being all round legends, and 
% spending e.g. Christmas with muh. Auntie Caz, Sean and Annabel - thanks for letting me stay
% every time I needed to go to Gatwick, and welcoming me with a beer and a smile.
% Nick and Jack -- 
% And how could I forget the beys. Thankyou Josh, James and Alex, and our now manager John,
% for allowing me to play music that I love in Waking Aida. 
% Eschaton and Full Heal were both released during my PhD, and in many ways 
% they are each a thesis within themselves. }
