Outflows are ubiquitous in accreting systems across 10 orders of magnitude in mass,
and there is good evidence that mass-loaded winds are launched from the accretion discs of
quasars and cataclysmic variables (CVs). Perhaps the most spectacular evidence for accretion disc winds is the blue-shifted, 
broad absorption lines (BALs) in UV resonance lines, seen in CVs and the 
BAL quasars. As well as imprinting absorption features, disc winds
may affect the line and continuum emission from accreting objects. They thus offer
a natural way to {\em unify} much of the phenomenology of CVs and active galactic nuclei (AGN).
% When one considers that
% disc winds are also a possible mechanism for AGN feedback, it becomes clear 
% that understanding the physics and true spectral imprint of these winds is of wide-ranging astrophysical significance.

In this thesis, I use a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) 
code, \py, to conduct a series of simulations designed to test
simple biconical disc wind models. I outline
the MCRT techniques used, before describing a series of code validation exercises. 
Having tested my methods thoroughly, I explore whether the winds that are 
responsible for the UV BALs in high-state CVs could also have an 
effect on the optical spectrum. I find that the wind produces
strong emission in the Balmer series, \heiiopt\ and a series of He~\textsc{i} lines. 
The model shows the observed trends with inclination and in some cases 
produces sufficient recombination continuum emission to fill 
in the Balmer photoabsorption edge intrinsic to disc atmospheres. 
The results suggest that disc winds could have a significant impact on the
optical spectra of high-state CVs.

The next step was to apply the techniques to quasar winds in a test of 
disc wind unification models. In previous efforts, the outflow tended to become
`over-ionized', and BAL features were only present if the X-ray luminosity was
limited to around $10^{43}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. The outflow also
failed to produce significant line emission.
Motivated by these problems, I introduce a simple treatment of clumping
and find that it allows BAL features to form in the rest-frame UV at more 
realistic X-ray luminosities. The fiducial model shows good agreement with AGN X-ray 
properties and the wind produces strong line emission. 
Despite these successes, the model cannot reproduce all emission lines seen in 
quasar spectra with the correct equivalent width (EW) ratios, and I find the
emission line EWs have a strong dependence on inclination.

Informed by the quasar wind modelling, I examine the emission line EW distributions
of quasars in the context of geometric unification. I find that the observed 
distributions are not consistent with a model in which an equatorial BAL 
outflow rises from a foreshortened accretion disc. I discuss this finding
in the context of other observational orientation indicators.
Finally, I summarise my findings and suggest avenues for future work.
Overall, the work presented here suggests that {\em disc winds matter}. 
They not only act as a spectral `filter' for the underlying
accretion continuum, but may actually dominate the emergent spectrum from 
accreting objects. As a result, unveiling their driving mechanisms, 
mass-loss rates and ionization structure is an important goal for the 
astronomical community.

%\addtocontents{toc}{\vspace{1em}}  % Add a gap in the Contents, for aesthetics

I, James Matthews, declare that this thesis titled, `Disc Winds Matter: Modelling Accretion and Outflow on All Scales' and the work presented in it are my own. I confirm that:

\begin{itemize} 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] This work was done wholly or mainly while in candidature for a research degree at this University.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where any part of this thesis has previously been submitted for a degree or any other qualification at this University or any other institution, this has been clearly stated.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have consulted the published work of others, this is always clearly attributed.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have quoted from the work of others, the source is always given. With the exception of such quotations, this thesis is entirely my own work.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] I have acknowledged all main sources of help.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where the thesis is based on work done by myself jointly with others, I have made clear exactly what was done by others and what I have contributed myself.
\end{itemize}
The first two chapters of this thesis provide a general introduction to the field, and thus
are based on the relevant literature. Where a figure is not produced by me, I have acknowledged 
this clearly with a credit to the relevant publication. Chapter 3 contains a description
of the methods used. This is partly a description of the radiative transfer code \py, which
was originally developed by Knox Long and Christian Knigge \citep{LK02}, but also includes substantial
detail on the `macro-atom' technique, which was proposed by Leon Lucy and incorporated into \py\
by Stuart Sim for a study on young-stellar objects \citep{simmacro2005}. 
Although I have put significant effort into testing, fixing and developing this scheme, 
I did not write the original code to deal with macro-atoms in \py.

Chapter 4, 5 and 6 were studies I led under the guidance of my supervisor. For these
chapters I conducted all simulations and data analysis, produced all the figures and 
wrote the text. A publication based on chapter 6 is in preparation, and
chapters 4 and 5 are based on the following papers:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Chapter 4: Matthews J. H., Knigge C., Long K. S., Sim S. A., Higginbottom N., 
`The impact of accretion disc winds on the optical spectra of 
cataclysmic variables',
2015, MNRAS, 450, 3331.
	\item Chapter 5: Matthews J. H., Knigge C., Long K. S., Sim S. A., Higginbottom N., Mangham S. W., 
`Testing quasar unification: radiative transfer in clumpy winds',
2016, MNRAS, 458, 293.
\end{itemize}
The following additional publications are not included in this thesis, although some of the work 
presented here did contribute towards the respective results
\begin{itemize}
	\item Higginbottom N., Knigge C., Long K. S., Sim S. A., Matthews J. H., 
`A simple disc wind model for broad absorption line quasars', 2013,  
MNRAS, 436, 2.3
	\item Higginbottom, N., Proga D., Knigge C., Long K. S., Matthews J. H., Sim S. A.,
	`Line-driven Disk Winds in Active Galactic Nuclei: The Critical Importance of Ionization' 
	and Radiative Transfer, 2014, ApJ, 789, 1.
	\item Shankar F., Calderone G., Knigge C., Matthews J. H., et al., `The Optical--UV Emissivity of Quasars: Dependence on Black Hole Mass and Radio Loudness', 2016, ApJ Letters, 818, 1.

First and foremost, I would like to thank Christian Knigge, for being
such an enthusiastic, helpful and stimulating supervisor throughout my PhD. 
Christian, I {\em always} left our meetings more positive than before -- that speaks
volumes -- and I greatly enjoyed our conversations about science and
Explosions in the Sky. I am also extremely grateful to Knox Long
for all his assistance, writing the majority of the code and sharing some
of his astronomy knowledge with me, and Stuart Sim for being immensely 
helpful throughout, especially when it comes to radiative transfer.
I would also like to thank Nick Higginbottom for hours upon hours of assistance
and friendship, and Sam Mangham for his help and input nearer the end of my PhD.
To all of the above people; thank you for being part of a collaboration that
does some great science, but also knew when to discuss a disastrous 
code bug with a knowing smile and ironic joke. 
I would also like to thank Daniel Proga, Omer Blaes, Ivan Hubeny, Shane Davis,
Mike Brotherton, Mike DiPompeo, Frederic Marin, Daniel Capellupo, Dirk Grupe,
Simo Scaringi, Adam Foster, Randall Smith, Chris Done, Anna Pala, Boris Gaensicke, 
Patrick Woudt and countless others for useful correspondence or stimulating scientific 
conversations. I am also very grateful to my masters supervisor
Rosanne Di Stefano for inspiring me to continue doing research beyond my year in 
Boston, and to Lance Miller and Poshak Gandhi for being fair, friendly
and helpful PhD examiners.	

Apart from those who I worked with, I am grateful to 
everyone who helped make Southampton a happy place to be over 3+ years.
There are too many to name, but I will indulge a few. To Cat, thank you for being
generally lovely, being so patient with me and having great taste in comedy. 
To Sam Connolly, you have been an ever-present and someone who I can always rely on for good 
beer, music and knowing looks. Sadie Jones, you were there when I needed 
you most for a cwtch or wanted to hear you pronounce year or ear. 
To Rob, Aarran, Juan, Georgios and Poppy, thanks for being true 
friends throughout the process. Big thanks to everyone else in the 
department for making it a super cool place to work, my
office mates Mari, Judith, Stew and CFro, and my housemates Rich, 
Stu, Luke, Ollie, Sophie and Szymon. Thanks also goes to all the staff for being so friendly 
and approachable, particularly Poshak, Diego, Francesco, Mark and Seb who have all helped me at 
various points through the PhD, and to Phil Charles for his sage advice since the early days.

There are also many people, outside of Southampton, who I must thank.
Most of all, Mum, Dad, Beth and Nick, and the rest of my family -- you have always
supported me throughout my studies and just been all round lovely people.
Cheers to Nick, Jack and the Hannahs for being great mates and helping me avoid 
Lemony Snickets. Thank you Josh, James and Alex, and our now manager John,
for allowing me to play music that I love in Waking Aida. 
Eschaton and Full Heal were both released during my PhD, and in many ways 
they are each a thesis within themselves. 

This work was supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council
via a 3.5 year PhD studentship. This work made use of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
