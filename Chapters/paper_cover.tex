The next three chapters consist of the three papers, which constitute the
main science body of this work. They are, in chronological order:

\bigskip
{\bf Chapter 4:} \\
{\sl ``The impact of accretion disc winds on the optical spectra of cataclysmic variables''}\\ 
James~H.~Matthews, Christian~Knigge, Knox~S.~Long, Stuart~A.~Sim, 
and Nick~Higginbottom, Published in 
{\sl Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 450, Issue 3, p.3331-3344.}

\bigskip
{\bf Chapter 5:} \\
{\sl ``Testing quasar unification: clumpy winds and radiative transfer''} \\
James~H.~Matthews, Christian~Knigge, Knox~S.~Long, Stuart~A.~Sim, 
Nick~Higginbottom and Sam~W.~Mangham, Published in 
{\sl Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, DOI: 10.1093/mnras/stw323.}


\bigskip
{\bf Chapter 6:} \\
{\sl ``Testing Quasar Unification II.: Orientation Effects and Emission Line Properties''}\\
James~H.~Matthews, Christian~Knigge, to be submitted to
{\sl Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.}

I can confirm, in accordance with the `three-paper PhD' guidelines, that as lead author
I have lead the research contained within these papers, including producing all figures and
writing the text. The reader will however notice a change of pronouns due to the 
collaborative nature of the work, and as each paper has a separate introduction there is
also some repetition of background material.
