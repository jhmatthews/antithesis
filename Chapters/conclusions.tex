I began this thesis with the fundamental tenet that accreting systems
and their associated outflows are astrophysically important. However, I also
demonstrated that much of the diverse phenomenology associated with such systems, as well
as the underlying {\em physics}, is not well understood.  
Having attempted to address some of the issues raised in the 
introductory chapters, I will provide some concluding remarks. 
First, I will summarise my findings, before 
commenting on how future research can help unveil the true nature of 
accretion discs and their winds.

A large portion of this PhD has been spent maintaining,
testing and developing the MCRT and ionization code, \py. The first 
step in this project was to understand the macro-atom scheme
developed by \cite{lucy2002,2003}, and it's specific integration
into \py. I described the scheme and the operation of \py\ in detail
in chapter 3, partly in the hope that it will prove a useful document
for future efforts involving this useful, but complex, piece of software.
The latter parts of the same chapter focused on the series of tests
I conducted to robustly verify that the code worked as expected and that 
it could reproduce the analytical and computational results in the 
right physical limits. Near the start of the project many of these tests
would fail, either because \py\ did not possess the relevant atomic data,
or because the necessary integration between the macro-atom and simple-atom
portions of the code was not yet in place. Thus, while time consuming,
progressing to the point where all the tests shown in chapter 3 could be
passed was an important milestone, and enabled the techniques in question
to be applied to astrophysical problems with confidence.

The first of these astrophysical problems involved CVs, and in particular
those accreting at a relatively high rate, such as DNe or NLs. Having 
improved the radiative transfer techniques from previous CV modelling efforts
involving \py\ \citep[LK02 ][]{noebauer2010}, it was now possible to see
if the outflows that are responsible for the P-Cygni profiles seen
in UV resonance lines could also affect the {\em optical} line and continuum
emission. The results were unambiguous. By simply taking the SV93/LK02
models -- designed to reproduce the UV spectra of high-state CVs --
and `turning on' the improved radiative transfer mode, the wind already 
had a significant effect on the optical spectrum, producing strong
\ha, \heiiopt\ and \heiioptnew\ lines, among others, at high inclinations.

I then conducted a small parameter search over just two kinematic parameters, 
to see if a model could produce {\em all} of the optical H and He lines observed 
in high-state CVs. A model with a more slowly accelerating outflow produced
synthetic spectra showing the full sequence of H and He recombination lines, with 
the observed trend from strong emission at high inclination to weaker lines
at low inclination. Furthermore, the dense outflow now produced strong Balmer
recombination emission that was sufficient to `fill in' the Balmer 
absorption edge intrinsic to the disc atmosphere input spectrum. The optically
optimised model is not without issues; the red wing to the \civ\ line
is now overly strong, particularly at high inclinations, and \heii\ emission
is stronger than that observed. Nevertheless, the synthetic spectra exhibited
reasonable verisimilitude with observations of the high inclination NL RW Tri,
and the results indicated that disc winds may have a much broader impact,
especially in wavelength terms, than is traditionally expected. Furthermore,
the large vertical extent of the line emitting region has implications
for techniques that assume planar line emission, such as Doppler tomograpgy (REFs)
and eclipse mapping (REFs).

In chapter 5, I applied similar techniques to the question of quasar 
unification, but with one additional adaptation. In order to simultaneously
increase the emission measure of the wind, as well as moderate the ionization
state in the presence of strong X-rays, I incorporated a simple treatment of clumping 
into \py. The technique -- known as {\em microclumping} -- is prevalent 
in the stellar wind community, but this was the first time it had been
applied to quasar winds in this context. Although the motivation for including
clumping was in some sense empirical, in that H13 could not produce a 
model with strong \civ\ BALs without severely limiting the X-ray luminosity, 
the validity of this approach is strengthened by the theoretical and observational
evidence for clumping in line-driven hot star winds 
(see section~\ref{sec:clumpy_stellar} and \ref{sec:line_driving}).

\section{Suggestions for Future Work}

\subsection{CVs as Accretion and Outflow Laboratories}

CVs are the closest and best understood laboratories for
our understanding of accretion physics. In particular, the NL
variables make excellent testbeds for the $\alpha$-disc model,
as they are one of the few accreting systems known to
lie in a relatively constant accretion rate state -- fulfilling 
an explicit assumption of the SS73 prescription. I suggest
that two observational programs relating to NLs are pursued.
The first is to take broadband, simultaneous spectroscopy of a number
of NL variables. This will allow the impact of winds on the spectrum
to be assessed more carefully as modelling of the entire wavelength
range can be undertaken, possibly including fits to the observed spectrum.
It will also allow the broadband SED to be fitted with confidence,
and inferences made about the temperature profile of the disc. 
The second is to take measurements of the depth of the Balmer jump
in a relatively large sample of NLs, either through narrow band spectroscopy
or two-band photometry. Together with inclination measurements the predictions
of disc and outflow models can be tested directly by exploring how the depth
of the Balmer absorption edge varies with viewing angle and accretion rate.

In chapter 4, the dominant source of heating in the benchmark CV model
is line heating. This means that accurate collision strengths are needed

\subsection{Obtaining Reliable Orientation Indicators}

A wide variety of quantities have been used as AGN orientation
indicators. However, many of these indicators are {\em model-dependent},
which is concerning given the lack of knowledge about the true
origins of the multi-wavelength AGN SED. Furthermore, I showed in
chapter 6 that it is not possible for \ewo, \fwh and radio-core 
dominance to {\em all} be reliable orientation indicators due to
the lack of the expected correlations between these measurements.

In order to distinguish between geometric unification, obscuration 
and evolutionary scenarios for the diversity of AGN it is 
critical to constrain their inclinations.

\section{Closing Remarks}

Above all, this work demonstrates that {\em disc winds matter}.
They are ubiquitous in accreting systems and appear to have a 
profound connection with the accretion process.
