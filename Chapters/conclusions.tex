I began this thesis with the fundamental tenet that accreting systems
and their associated outflows are astrophysically important, but that
much of the diverse phenomenology associated with such systems, as well
as the underlying {\em physics}, is not well understood.  
Having attempted to address some of the issues raised in the 
introductory chapters, I will provide some concluding remarks. 
First, I will summarise my findings, before 
commenting on how future research can unveil the true nature of 
accretion discs and their winds.

A large portion of the time of this PhD has been spent maintaining,
testing and developing the MCRT and ionization code, \py. The first 
step in this thesis was 



In the first study I demonstrated that accretion disc winds
can have a profound impact on the optical spectra of CVs -- a region
of the spectrum often assumed to have nothing to do with outflows.

In chapter 5, I applied similar techniques to the question of quasar 
unification.

\subsection{Obtaining Reliable Orientation Indicators}

A wide variety of quantities have been used as AGN orientation
indicators. However, many of these indicators are {\em model-dependent},
which is concerning given the lack of knowledge about the true
origins of the multi-wavelength AGN SED. Furthermore, I showed in
chapter 6 that it is not possible for \ewo, \fwh and radio-core 
dominance to {\em all} be reliable orientation indicators due to
the lack of the expected correlations between these measurements.

In order to distinguish between geometric unification, obscuration 
and evolutionary scenarios for the diversity of AGN it is 
critical to constrain their inclinations.

One of the conclusions presented in chapter 6, and also found
from multiple studies (REFs), is that it is not possib

\section{Closing Remarks}

Above all, this work demonstrates that {\em disc winds matter}.
They are ubiquitous in accreting systems and appear to have a 
profound connection with the accretion process.
