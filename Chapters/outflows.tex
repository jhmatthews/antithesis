\section{Observational Evidence}

The observational evidence for mass-loaded outflows or winds is 
widespread across the entire astrophysical mass range and most of
the electromagnetic spectrum. Before detailing the more compelling aspects
of this evidence, it is pertinent to briefly discuss the `smoking gun'
used to unambiguously detect winds -- the presence of blue shifted BALs
or `P-Cygni' profiles in an objects spectrum. 

Figure~?? shows how a spherical outflow of significant opacity will 
cause these characteristic line profile shapes to form, as scattering out of the line of sight 
causes a dip in the blue wing of the line, while scattering into the 
line of sight from other portions of the outflow causes an increase in flux
in the red wing of the line. The situation is much more complex in most
astrophysical situations; for example, the geometry is rarely spherically 
symmetric, and the line is rarely a pure scattering case. Indeed, the potential 
for complicated radiative transfer effects and variety in line formation mechanisms
is one of the reasons why 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations are necessary
to effectively model disc winds (see section 3).

\subsection{Cataclysmic Variables}

It has been known for a long time that winds emanating from the
accretion disc are important in shaping the ultraviolet (UV) spectra
of high-state CVs \citep{heap1978, greensteinoke1982}. The most spectacular evidence for such
outflows are the P-Cygni-like profiles seen in UV resonance lines such as
\civfull\ \citep[][; see figure~\ref{fig:cordova}]{cordova1982}). 
Considerable effort has been spent over the
years on understanding and modelling these UV features 
\citep[e.g.][]{drewverbunt1985,maucheraymond1987,SV93,KWD96,
kd1997,knigge1997,LK02,noebauer,puebla2011}. 
The basic picture emerging from these efforts is
of a slowly accelerating, moderately collimated bipolar
outflow that carries away $\simeq 1\% - 10\%$ of the accreting
material. State-of-the-art simulations of line formation in this type
of disc wind can produce UV line profiles that are remarkably similar
to observations, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:zcam_lk02}.

\end{figure}

Much less is known about the effect of these outflows on the optical
spectra of high-state CVs. Direct evidence of wind-formed lines comes from
isolated observations of P-Cygni-like line profiles in
\ha\ and He \textsc{i} $\lambda5876$, \citep{patterson1996, RN98, kafka2004}. 
However, the effect on
the {\em emission} aspects of the optical spectrum is not well known.
\cite{MC96, MC97} have shown that the presence of disc winds may
offer a natural explanation for the single-peaked optical emission lines in
high-state CVs, since they can strongly affect the radiative transfer
of line photons (see figure~??). Stronger support for a significant wind contribution to the
optical emission lines comes from observations of eclipsing
systems. There, the single-peaked lines are often only weakly
eclipsed, and a significant fraction of the line flux remains visible
even near mid-eclipse \citep[e.g.][]{baptista2000,groot2004}. 
This points to line formation in a spatially
extended region, such as a disc wind (see section~\ref{novalikes}).
It is also possible that a wind may affect the continuum emission of CVs,
as described in section~??. The effect of an accretion disc wind
on the optical line and continuum emission of CVs is addressed directly,
via radiative transfer modelling, in chapter 4.

% These spectra are typically characterized
% by H and He emission lines superposed on a blue continuum. In many
% cases, and particularly in the SW~Sex subclass of NLs
% \citep{HSK86,DR95}, these lines are single-peaked. This is contrary to
% theoretical expectations for lines formed in accretion discs, which
% are predicted to be double-peaked \citep{smak1981, hornemarsh1986}. 
% {\em Low-state} CVs (dwarf novae in quiescence) do, in fact,
% exhibit such double-peaked lines \citep{marshhorne1990}. 

% Could disc winds also have an impact on the UV/optical {\em continuum}
% of high-state CVs? This continuum is usually thought to be dominated
% by the accretion disc and modelled by splitting the disc into
% a set of concentric, optically thick, non-interacting annuli following
% the standard $T_{eff}(R) \propto R^{-3/4}$ radial temperature
% distribution \citep{shakurasunyaev1973}. In such
% models, each annulus is taken to emit either as a blackbody or,
% perhaps more realistically, as a stellar/disc atmosphere model
% \citep{Schwarzenberg-Czerny1977,wade1984,wade1988}.
% In the latter case, the local surface gravity, $\log{g}(R)$, is
% assumed to be set solely by the accreting WD, since self-gravity is
% negligible in CV discs.

\subsection{X-ray Binaries}
\label{sec:xrb_winds}

Like CVs, evidence for fast outflows in LMXBs is not constrained to 
a single waveband. UV absorption in outflows was detected when
\cite{ioannau2003} observed \civfull\ P-Cygni profiles with blueshifts 
of $\sim1500$km~s$^-1$. Shortly after, a series of papers found 
highly ionized Fe absorption with similar blueshifts and FWHM of around 
$1500$km~s$^-1$ (REFs). These absorption features tended to be detected
in high-inclination, `dipping' LMXBs, and this was confirmed in more sources
by \cite{ponti2012}, who proposed an equatorial geometry based on this (see 
figure~??). The same study demonstrated (figure~??) that
the winds only appeared in the soft, 
disc dominated accretion state, on the opposite side of the HID to the
region where jets are common. This exciting result demonstrated how
important winds are to our understanding of accretion, and required that
we expand the discussion of accretion states to include `disc-jet-wind' 
coupling.

\subsection{AGN and Quasars}
\label{sec:agn_winds}

\subsubsection{Broad Absorption Line Quasars}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/02-outflows/bal_spectra.png}
\caption
{
Five examples of BAL quasar spectra, from HST and SDSS.
} 
\label{fig:bals}
\end{figure}

Perhaps the clearest evidence of outflows in AGN is  
the blueshifted ($\sim 0.1~c$) broad absorption lines (BALs) in the 
ultraviolet seen in approximately $20\%$ of quasars
\citep{weymann1991, knigge2008, allen2011}. Five example
spectra of BAL quasars from the HST and SDSS archived are shown in 
figure~\ref{fig:bals}. In addition to the most common High-ionization
BAL quasars (HiBALs), approximately $10\%$ of BALQSOs show absorption
in lower ionization species such as \mgii\ and \aliii\ (`LoBALQSOs'),
and an even smaller subset also show absorption in Fe~\textsc{ii} and 
\textsc{iii} (`FeLoBALQSOs'). 

The simplest explanation for the incidence of 
BAL quasars (BALQSOs) is in terms of an accretion disc wind viewed
from different angles. This principle of geometric unification
is very similar to the idea behing the UP95 and AM95 models discussed in Chapter 1.
According to this paradigm, a biconical wind rises from 
the accretion disc and the BALQSO fraction is associated with
the covering factor of the outflow. This fraction
has been estimated by various authors using different selection criteria.
REFS TO TRUMP KNIGGE ALLEN WEYMANN
The BAL fraction can also interpreted in an {\em evolutionary}
context, in which quasars send a certain proportion of their life
in the `BAL phase'. Models generally put this phase near the start
of the quasar lifetime (REFs), after a dust enshrowded phase but before
the main quasar period. It is perhaps more likely that {\em both} 
evolutionary and geometric effects are at work (REFs). 
The latter chapters of this thesis are dedicated
to testing the geometric unification model, or `Occam's quasar' (see Chapter 1),
and establishing how close this simple picture can get to explaining 
the BAL phenomenon.  

While $f_{BAL}$ is a very useful number and must be at least
related to the covering factor of the outflow, continuum selection
effects \citep{goodrich1997,krolikvoit1998}, 
as well as reddening \citep{allen2011}, could significantly
alter the true value of $f_{BAL}$. The degree of collimation of the BAL wind
is also not well known. Polarisation studies suggest that the 
wind is roughly equatorial \citep{goodrich1995, cohen1995}, 
as also found from hydrodynamical simulations  
but there is also evidence for polar BAL outflows in 
radio-loud (RL) sources \citep{zhou2006,ghoshpunsly2007}.
In addition to these uncertainties, the physical scale of the BAL
phenomenon is also disputed, and may vary from object to object.
If one assumes that the BAL region is on the same scale as 
the BLR then the radius of the absorbing material
can be estimated as $\sim 100-1000 r_G$ from reverberation mapping
and microlensing \citep[e.g., for BLRs in BALQSOs,][]{sluse2015,odowd2015}.
However, distances of  $\sim0.1$~pc ($\sim 10^4 r_G$) have been measured in at least 
some objects from fairly robust atomic physics arguments 
\citep{borguet2014,chamberlain2015}.

BAL quasars display a variety of different trough shapes from object 
to object, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:bals}. Furthermore, the 
line profiles themselves often show complex structure 
\citep{ganguly2006, simonhamann2010} and can be time variable 
\citep{capellupo2011,capellupo2012,capellupo2014}. 
Many BAL quasars exhibit detached troughs (REFs).

Due to the connection between X-rays and photoionization / absorption, the 
X-ray properties of BAL quasars are particularly important. BALQSOs
are universally X-ray weak when compared to non-BAL quasars. 
The X-ray weakness of BALQSOs is often attributed to X-ray absorption 
with column densities of $N_H \sim 10^{22-24}$~cm$^{-2}$ 
\citep{gallagher1999,gallagher2002,green2001,grupe2003,stalin2011},
although there is also evidence that BALQSOs are {\em intrinsically}
X-ray weak \citep{sabra2001,clavel2006,morabito2013}.
The X-ray properties of BAL quasars are fundamentally coupled to 
the properties of the wind -- the X-ray absorption may be caused by 
the outflow which in turn has its ionization state 
determined by the X-ray radiation. Furthermore, the true X-ray 
luminosities cannot be reliably inferred until inclinations of BALQSOs are
constrained, as gravitational lensing will significantly alter the
emergent angular distribution of X-ray emission even for an intrinsically
isotropic source \citep{chen2013a, chen2013b}.

Although the X-rays in BALQSOs are weaker than in similar mass quasars,
they still possess strong ionizing power. This leads to what has become
known as the `over-ionization problem' in BALQSOs; how is the moderate 
ionization state of the BAL gas maintained in the presence of ionizing 
X-rays? A number of potential solutions have been proposed, which can be 
broadly separated into `shielding' models \citep{MCGV95,PK04} and `clumpy'
models \citep{dekool1995,hamann2013}. Some of these models are discussed
further in section~\ref{sec:wind_models} and chapter~5.

\subsubsection{Warm Absorbers}

Warm absorbers (WAs) are regions of photoionized plasma responsible for some
of the characteristic absorption features seen in the X-ray spectra of AGN 
\citep{reynolds1995}.
In particular, they produce photoelectric continuum absorption 
\citep[e.g.][]{halpern1984,cappi1996,kriss1996}
and a series of narrow absorption lines in H-like and He-like ions of 
C, N, O, Si, Ne, and Fe \citep{kaastra2000}, that appear in the soft X-rays.
A wind origin is a common hypothesis for WAs 
\citep[e.g.][]{krolikkriss2001}. Clear evidence for this 
comes from the measured blueshifts of the lines, typically on the order of 
$\sim100$km~s$^{-1}$. X-ray absorption and WAs are often
variable \citep{fabian1994,otani1996}, which may be interpreted in terms of 
changing kinematics of an accretion disc wind \citep{connolly2014}. 
There is also evidence of contemporary UV and X-ray absorption 
in NGC 5548 \citep{kaastra}, and as mentioned above BALQSOs 
are often absorbed in the X-rays. This suggests that the outflow phenomenon 
across a large range of ionization states and line energies is linked. 

WAs can, in some cases, be modelled well with single component 
models \citep{kaastra2000}, but often
require multiple ionization state absorbers 
\citep[e.g.][]{kriss1996,orr1997,krolikkriss2001,connolly2014}.
If this is the case, then self-consistent ionization and radiative transfer models
should really be used to model the spectrum (see e.g. chapter 3), 
as optically thin ionization parameter estimates will not capture 
the ionization and radiation physics.
The collated observations point towards some kind of outflow with a stratified ionization
structure, with $\log \xi \sim 0-2$, and densities on the order of $10^8$~cm. 
These physical conditions or scales are not well constrained, and the connection to 
other outflows is unknown. Timing observations will help to shed light on 
the properties of the mysterious, but ubiquitous, 
AGN WAs \citep{silva2015}.

\subsubsection{Ultra-fast Outflows}

As well as acting as WAs, winds also imprint clear absorption features
in highly ionized Fe~K$\alpha$ lines in AGN such as PDS~456 
\citep{reeves2003, gofford2014,matzeu2016},
MCG-5-23-16 \citep{braito2007} and PG 1211+143 \citep{poundsreeves2009,fukumura2015}.
These features are fairly common in Seyfert galaxies \citep{tombesi2010a, gofford2013}. 
An example of such a feature is shown in 
figure~\ref{fig:nardini} with a simply spherical outflow model fit, 
from \citep{nardini2015}. The high velocities ($\sim0.1c$) inferred 
from the line blueshifts have lead to these winds becoming known as 
ultra-fast outflows, or UFOs. 

UFOs are characterised by ionization parameters of $\log \xi \sim 3-4$,
and column densities of $N_H > 10^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$. Their high mass-loss rates
and large energy budgets mean that they are natural candidates for
AGN feedback (see section~\ref{sec:agn_feedback}). Measurements of
their kinetic luminosities suggest that UFOs do have sufficient 
energy to affect their host galaxy \citep{gofford2015}, and a recent observation
showed a molecular outflow in a UFO host galaxy, possibly driven 
by the UFO itself \citep{tombesi2015}. As with WAs, many of the models
used to constrain physical parameters are simplistic, and assume 
single ionization parameters, large covering factor
and thin expanding shells of outflow.
Under these assumptions, the mass loss rate can be estimated using
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hse}
\dot{M} \sim \Omega N_H m_p v_{out} R_{in}
\end{equation}
In reality, the absorber is probably much more complex, and full 
RT and photoionization simulations are required. In a series of papers, 
\cite{simlong2008,sim2010,sim2010_hydro} carried out such calculations,
and found reasonable verisimilitude with Fe line profiles could be achieved.
However, as with many models for AGN, a holistic, broad wavelength range
fit is still required.

\subsection{Stellar Winds}

Although stellar winds are clearly not accretion disc winds,
they provide a useful, and better understood, testing ground for much
of the physics of radiatively-driven outflows.

\subsubsection{Clumping}

\subsection{Outflow Physics}

The spectra in figures~\ref{fig:bals}, \ref{fig:cordova}
and \ref{fig:stellar_wind} show striking similarities -- 
characteristic P-Cygni-like absorption features in UV resonance
lines at very similar ionization states. Furthermore, some of the
phenomena observed in e.g. stellar winds may naturally solve some of 
the unanswered questions in other systems -- for example, clumping
in the outflow as a moderator of the ionization state. It would seem
that at least some of the physics of outflows, like accretion,
is universal, and that lessons learned from smaller scale systems may be
scaleable to AGN and quasars. However, first we must discuss the 
underlying physical mechanisms that may be responsible for accelerating
these outflows.


\section{Driving Mechanisms}

Let us consider a parcel of ideal gas. By imposing nothing more than
conservation of mass, energy and momentum on that parcel we can write down
three equations of hydrodynamics
\footnote{I stress that these equations are not used in hydrodynamic
simulations in this thesis (see section ?, for example); 
they are discussed here because they provide a natural reference point
for exploring potential driving mechanisms for winds in accreting systems.
}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:continuity}
\frac{D \rho}{Dt} + \rho \nabla \cdot \vec{v} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:motion}
\rho \frac{Dv}{Dt} = -\nabla P + \frac{1}{4 \pi}(\nabla \times \vec{B}) \times \vec{B} + \rho \vec{F}_{rad} + \rho \vec{g}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:energy}
\rho \frac{D}{Dt} \left(\frac{e}{\rho}\right) = P \nabla \cdot \vec{v} + \rho \cal{L}
\end{equation}

Here $D$ denotes a derivative within the comoving frame of the gas parcel, $\vec{v}$ is the velocity,
$\rho$ is the gas density, $\vec{B}$ is the local magnetic field, $\vec{F}_{rad}$ is the radiation
force per unit mass and $\vec{g}$ denotes the gravitational acceleration vector.
Equation~\ref{eq:continuity} is the {\em continuity equation} and describes conservation of mass. 
Equation~\ref{eq:motion} is the {\em equation of motion} and describes conservation of momentum.
Equation~\ref{eq:energy} is the {\em equation of energy conservation}. 
We can use equation~\ref{eq:motion} to neatly demonstrate how an outflow can be driven. I have 
deliberately written the equation so that all the force terms lie on the RHS. We can then see that
for an outflow to be driven from an accreting object one simply needs one of the terms on
the RHS to dominate over gravity, $\rho \vec{g}$. These terms thus signify three potential
driving mechanisms.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Magnetic Forces, $\frac{1}{4 \pi}(\nabla \times \vec{B}) \times \vec{B}$.
	\item Radiative Forces, $\rho \vec{F}_{rad}$.
	\item Thermal Pressure, $-\nabla P$.
\end{itemize}

We can now examine under what physical conditions 
(and in which corresponding astrophysical objects)
we might expect these forces to overcome gravity and 
cause a parcel of mass to escape to infinity.
In other words: {\em what might drive a wind?}

\subsection{Thermal Winds}

In hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE), thermal pressure balances gravity and no other forces 
are present, meaning that the equation of motion can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:hse}
\rho \frac{Dv}{Dt} = -\nabla P +  \rho \vec{g} = 0
\end{equation}
Clearly, if the thermal pressure is then significantly 
increased then this equilibrium condition no longer holds. 
This can occur in accretion discs at temperatures in excess of $\sim10^7$~K --
where other forces are negligible compared to thermal pressure -- 
and where the escape velocities are relatively low (i.e. far out in the disc).
Due to the temperature and gravity scalings, this means
that XRBs are natural candidates for showing evidence of thermally driven
winds. The outer disc can be heated to the Compton temperature by the central X-ray source,
potentially driving relatively high mass-loss rate outflows \citep{begelman1983,woods1996}. 
This driving mechanism has been proposed as a natural explanation
for the ever-present equatorial outflows in soft state XRBs \citep{ponti2012}.
However, they are much less likely candidates in CVs and AGN, because
the escape velocity tends to greatly exceed the thermal velocity.

\subsection{Radiatively Driven Winds}
\label{sec:rad_winds}



\subsection{Line-driven Winds}

\subsection{Magnetic Winds}
\label{sec:magq_winds}

Magnetic fields are one of the main proposed mechanisms for transporting
angular momentum outwards in the disc via the MRI. This would imply
that magnetic fields are important in shaping accretion discs and makes
then attractive as a driving mechanism for disc winds.

There are two main ways in which magnetic forces can drive an 
accretion disc wind. Historically, the most popular idea has been the `bead on a wire' mechanism proposed by \citep{blandfordpayne}. In this model,
the {\em poloidal} magnetic field is dominant, and 

\section{Accretion Disc Wind Models}
\label{sec:wind_models}

A number of different wind models have appeared in the literature over the 
years, each attempting to explain a number of different observational characteristics
of quasars with a mixture of conceptual frameworks and underlying physics. 
Typically, the models attempt to explain the origins of BLR and BAL gas, although
some extend their remit into the infra-red, radio and X-ray regimes.
I will briefly discuss a few examples that have gained traction over the years,
before outlining the kinematic prescription I have used in the science chapters
of this thesis.

\section{The big picture: AGN Feedback}
\label{sec:agn_feedback}

The event horizon of a $10^9~M_\odot$ BH is approximately 
$10^{15}$~cm, a billionth of the size of a typical galactic bulge. This is 
roughly the difference in size between a small coin and the 
Earth. Even the sphere of gravitational influence of the BH is roughly 
1000 times smaller than the size of the galactic bulge.
Despite this vast different in scale, there are multiple
pieces of evidence that the physics on the scale of the gravitational
radius of the BH really does affect the evolution and dynamics of its host galaxy.
When considering the energetics of accretion this becomes less surprising.
The binding energy of a galactic bulge is 
\begin{equation}
E_{bulge} = M_{bulge} \sigma_*^2
\end{equation}



I shall briefly discuss the evidence for this statement, and 
assess the potential role of winds together with alternative mechanisms.

\subsection{Observational evidence for feedback}

Perhaps the most famous pieces of evidence for some kind of long-distance 
relationship between a central BH and its host galaxy are the 
$M_{BH}-\sigma_*$ and $M_{BH}-M_{bulge}$ correlations, shown in figures~\ref{fig:msigma}
and \ref{fig:mbulge} respectively.
