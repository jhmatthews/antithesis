\section{Types of Accreting Systems}

\subsection{Cataclysmic Variables}

Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are systems in which a white dwarf
accretes matter from a donor star via Roche-lobe overflow. In
non-magnetic systems this accretion is mediated by a Keplerian disk
around the white dwarf (WD). Nova-like variables (NLs) are a subclass
of CVs in which the  disk is always in a relatively
high-accretion-rate state ($\dot{M} \sim 10^{-8}$~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$).  
This makes NLs an excellent laboratory for studying the properties of 
steady-state accretion disks.
