% It has been known for a long time that winds emanating from the
% accretion disc are important in shaping the ultraviolet (UV) spectra
% of high-state CVs \citep{heap1978, greensteinoke1982}. The most spectacular evidence for such
% outflows are the P-Cygni-like profiles seen in UV resonance lines such as
% \civfull\ (see e.g. Cordova \& Mason
% 1982\nocite{cordova1982}). Considerable effort has been spent over the
% years on understanding and modelling these UV features (e.g. Drew \&
% Verbunt 1985\nocite{drewverbunt1985}; Mauche \& Raymond
% 1987\nocite{maucheraymond1987}; Drew 1987; Shlosman \& Vitello 1993; [hereafter
% SV93]\nocite{SV93}; Knigge, Woods \& Drew 1995\nocite{KWD95}; 
% Knigge \& Drew 1997\nocite{kd1997}; 
% Knigge et al. 1997\nocite{knigge1997}; Long \& Knigge 2002 [hereafter LK02]\nocite{LK02}, 
% Noebauer et al. 2010\nocite{noebauer};
% Puebla et al. 2011\nocite{puebla2011}). The basic picture emerging from these efforts is
% of a slowly accelerating, moderately collimated bipolar
% outflow that carries away $\simeq 1\% - 10\%$ of the accreting
% material. State-of-the-art simulations of line formation in this type
% of disc wind can produce UV line profiles that are remarkably similar
% to observations.

% Much less is known about the effect of these outflows on the optical
% spectra of high-state CVs. These spectra are typically characterized
% by H and He emission lines superposed on a blue continuum. In many
% cases, and particularly in the SW~Sex subclass of NLs
% \citep{HSK86,DR95}, these lines are single-peaked. This is contrary to
% theoretical expectations for lines formed in accretion discs, which
% are predicted to be double-peaked \citep{smak1981, hornemarsh1986}. 
% {\em Low-state} CVs (dwarf novae in quiescence) do, in fact,
% exhibit such double-peaked lines \citep{marshhorne1990}. 

% Murray \& Chiang (1996, 1997; hereafter referred to collectively as MC96)\nocite{MC96, MC97} 
% have shown that the presence of disc winds may
% offer a natural explanation for the single-peaked optical emission lines in
% high-state CVs, since they can strongly affect the radiative transfer
% of line photons. Strong support for a significant wind contribution to the
% optical emission lines comes from observations of eclipsing
% systems. There, the single-peaked lines are often only weakly
% eclipsed, and a significant fraction of the line flux remains visible
% even near mid-eclipse \citep[e.g.][]{baptista2000,groot2004}. 
% This points to line formation in a spatially
% extended region, such as a disc wind (see Fig.~\ref{novalikes}).
% %%(Honeycutt, Schlegel, \& Kaitchuck 1986; Dhillon \& Rutten 1995). 
% Further evidence for a wind contribution to the optical lines comes
% from isolated observations of P-Cygni-like line profiles even in optical
% lines, such as \ha\ and He \textsc{i} $\lambda5876$ \citep{patterson1996, RN98, kafka2004}.

% Could disc winds also have an impact on the UV/optical {\em continuum}
% of high-state CVs? This continuum is usually thought to be dominated
% by the accretion disc and modelled by splitting the disc into
% a set of concentric, optically thick, non-interacting annuli following
% the standard $T_{eff}(R) \propto R^{-3/4}$ radial temperature
% distribution \citep{shakurasunyaev1973}. In such
% models, each annulus is taken to emit either as a blackbody or,
% perhaps more realistically, as a stellar/disc atmosphere model
% \citep{Schwarzenberg-Czerny1977,wade1984,wade1988}.
% In the latter case, the local surface gravity, $\log{g}(R)$, is
% assumed to be set solely by the accreting WD, since self-gravity is
% negligible in CV discs.

% Attempts to fit the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
% high-state CVs with such models have met with mixed success. In
% particular, the SEDs predicted by most stellar/disc atmosphere models 
% are too blue in the UV \citep{wade1988,long1991,long1994,knigge1998} and exhibit
% stronger-than-observed Balmer jumps in absorption 
% \citep{wade1984,haug1987,ladous1989b,knigge1998}. One possible
% explanation for these problems is that these models fail to capture
% all of the relevant physics. Indeed, it has been argued that a
% self-consistent treatment can 
% produce better agreement with observational data (e.g. Shaviv et
% al. 1991;  but see also Idan et al. 2010).
% \nocite{idanshaviv2010} \nocite{shaviv1991}
% However, an alternative explanation, suggested by Knigge et al.
% (1998b; see also Hassall et al. 1985)\nocite{KLWB98,hassall}, 
% is that recombination continuum emission from the base of the 
% disc wind might fill in the disc's
% Balmer absorption edge and flatten the UV spectrum.

Here, we carry out Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations in
order to assess the likely impact of accretion disc winds on the
optical spectra of high-state CVs. More specifically, our goal is to
test whether disc winds of the type developed to account for the UV
resonance lines would also naturally produce significant amounts of  
optical line and/or continuum emission. In order to achieve this, we
have implemented the `macro-atom' approach developed by Lucy
(2002, 2003) into the Monte Carlo ionization and radiative transfer
code described by LK02 (a process initiated by Sim et al. 2005; hereafter SDL05). 
With this upgrade, the code is able to deal correctly with processes involving
excited levels, such as the recombination emission produced by CV
winds. 

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section~2, we
briefly describe the code and and the newly implemented macro-atom
approach. In Section~3, we describe the kinematics and geometry of our
disc wind model. 
In Section~4, we present spectra simulated from the benchmark model
employed by LK02, and, in Section~5, we present a revised model
optimized for the optical waveband. In Section~6, we summarize our
findings.

%
%          THE CODE, RADIATIVE TRANSFER
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \section{\sc{python}: A Monte Carlo Ionization and Radiative Transfer Code}

% \py\ is a Monte Carlo  ionization and radiative transfer code which
% uses the Sobolev approximation to treat line transfer 
% \citep[e.g.][]{sobolev1957,sobolev1960,rybickihummer1978}. 
% The code has already been described extensively by LK02, SDL05 and Higginbottom et al. (2013; hereafter H13), so here we provide only a brief summary of its operation, 
% focusing particularly on new
% aspects of our implementation of macro-atoms into the code. 

% \subsection{Basics} 

% \py\ operates in two distinct stages. First, the ionization state,
% level populations and temperature structure are calculated. This is
% done iteratively, by 
% propagating several populations of Monte Carlo energy quanta (`photons')
% through a model wind. The geometric and kinemetic properties of the
% outflow are specified on a pre-defined spatial grid. In each of these
% iterations (`ionization cycles'), the code records estimators that 
% characterize the radiation field in each grid cell. At the end 
% of each ionization cycle, a new electron temperature is calculated
% that more closely balances heating and cooling in the 
% plasma. The radiative estimators and updated electron
% temperature are then used to revise the ionization state of the wind,
% and a new ionization cycle is started. The process is repeated until
% heating and cooling are balanced throughout the wind. 

% This converged model is then used as the basis for the second set of
% iterations (`spectral cycles'). In these, the emergent spectrum over
% the desired spectral range is synthesized by tracking populations of
% energy packets through the wind and computing the emergent spectra at
% a number of user-specified viewing angles.  

% \py\ is designed to operate in a number of different
% regimes, both in terms of the scale of the system and in terms of the
% characteristics of the underlying radiation field.
% It was originally developed by LK02 in order to model the UV spectra
% of CVs with a simple biconical disc wind model. SDL05
% \nocite{simmacro2005} used the code to model Brackett
% and Pfund line profiles of H in young-stellar objects (YSOs). As part
% of this effort, they implemented a `macro-atom' mode (see below) in
% order to correctly treat H recombination lines with
% \py. Finally, H13 used \py\ to model broad absorption line (BAL) QSOs. For
% this application, an improved treatment of ionization was implemented,
% so that the code is now capable of dealing with arbitrary
% photo-ionizing SEDs, including non-thermal and multi-component ones. 

% \subsection{Ionization and Excitation: `Simple Atoms'}
% \label{simpleatoms}

% Prior to SDL05, the relative ionization fractions for all atomic
% species were estimated via the modified Saha equation (Mazzali \&
% Lucy 1993)  
% \begin{equation}
% \frac{n_{j+1} n_e}{n_j} = W [\xi + W(1-\xi)]
% \left(\frac{T_e}{T_R}\right)^{1/2}
% \left(\frac{n_{j+1}n_e}{n_j}\right)^*_{T_R}. \label{ionization}
% \end{equation}
% Here, the `starred' term on the right represents abundances computed with
% the Saha equation at temperature $T_R$, but using partition functions
% from the dilute blackbody approximation. 
% $W$ is an effective dilution factor, $\xi$ is the
% fraction of recombinations going directly to the ground state, and
% $T_R$ and $T_e$ are the radiation and electron temperatures,
% respectively. This simple ionization scheme produces reasonable
% results when the photoionizing SED can be approximated by a dilute
% blackbody. This is the case for high-state CVs. (As noted above, an
% improved, but more complex treatment of ionization that is appropriate
% for more complex SEDs is described in H13.) 

% Similarly, the relative excitation fractions within each ionization
% stage of a given species were estimated via a modified (dilute) Boltzmann
% equation,
% \begin{equation}
% \frac{n_{jk}}{n_j} = \frac{W g_k}{z_j(T_R)} \exp(-E_k/kT_R),
% \end{equation}
% where $n_{jk}$ is the population of level $k$ in ionic stage $j$,
% $E_k$ is the energy difference between level $k$ and the ground state,
% $g_k$ is the statistical weight of level $k$
% and $z_j(T_R)$ is the partition function of ionic stage $j$. 

% Finally, \py\ originally modelled all bound-bound processes as transitions
% within a simple two-level atom \cite[e.g.][]{mihalas}. 
% This framework was used for the treatment of line transfer and also
% for the line heating and cooling calculations (see LK02). 
% The approximation works reasonably well for resonance  
% lines, such as \civfull, in which the lower level is the ground state.  
% However, it is a poor approximation for many other
% transitions, particularly those where the upper level
% is primarily populated from above. Thus an improved method for
% estimating excited level populations and simulating line transfer is
% needed in order to model recombination lines and continua.

% \subsection{Ionization and Excitation: Macro-Atoms}

% Lucy (2002, 2003\nocite{lucy2002, lucy2003}; hereafter L02, L03) 
% has shown that it is possible to calculate the emissivity of a gas in
% statistical equilibrium accurately by quantising matter into
% `macro-atoms', and radiant and kinetic energy into indivisible energy
% packets (r- and k- packets, respectively). His macro-atom scheme
% allows for all possible transition paths from a given level and
% provides a full non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) solution
% for the level populations based on Monte Carlo estimators. The macro-atom
% technique has already been used to model Wolf-Rayet star
% winds \citep{sim2004}, AGN disc winds \citep{simlong2008, tatum2012},
% supernovae \citep{kromersim2009, kerzendorfsim} and YSOs (SDL05). A full 
% description of the approach can be found in L02 and L03. 

% Briefly, macro-atom NLTE level populations and ionization fractions
% are calculated by solving the statistical equilbrium equations between
% each pair of levels. In the framework of the Sobolev escape probability formalism (Rybicki \& Hummer 1978; L02; Sim 2004), 
% the bound-bound excitation rate, ${\cal R}_{lu}$, in an ion is given by 
% \begin{equation}
% {\cal R}_{lu} = B_{lu} n_l J_{est} + C_{lu} n_l n_e,
% \end{equation}
% where $u$ and $l$ denote the upper and lower levels, $C$ represents the
% collisional rate coefficients, and $B$ is the usual Einstein
% coefficient. $J_{est}$ is the Monte Carlo estimator for the mean intensity 
% impinging on the Sobolev region, weighted by an angle-dependent escape probability, 
% given by \citep{sim2004}
% \begin{equation}
% J_{est} = \frac{c}{4 \pi \nu_0 V} \sum_{i} w_i \frac{1 - e^{-\tau_{s,i}}}{\tau_{s,i}} \frac{1}{(dv/ds)_i}.
% \end{equation}
% Here $w$ is the photon weight (in luminosity units), $\nu_0$
% is the line frequency, $dv/ds$ is the velocity gradient and
% $\tau_s$ is the Sobolev optical depth.
% The sum is over all photons that come into resonance with the line,
% and thus represents an integral over solid angle.
% The corresponding de-excitation rate is then 
% \begin{equation}
% {\cal R}_{ul} = \beta_{lu} A_{ul} n_u + B_{ul} n_u J_{est} +
% C_{ul} n_u n_e,
% \label{eq:nlte_rul}
% \end{equation}
% where $A$ is the usual Einstein coefficient. 
% The quantity $\beta_{lu}$ is the {\em angle-averaged} probability 
% that a given line photon will escape the Sobolev region.

% In our implementation of the macro-atom approach, we also explicitly
% take into account the photoionization and collisional ionization rates
% between a lower level, $l$, and the continuum (or, in the case of ions
% with more than one bound electron, the ground state of the upper ion),
% $\kappa$,
% \begin{equation}
% {\cal R}_{l \kappa}= n_l \int_{\nu_0}^{\infty} \frac{ 4 \pi J_{\nu}
%   \sigma_{\nu}}{h \nu} d\nu + C_{l \kappa} n_l n_e.
% \end{equation}
% Here, $\sigma_{\nu}$ is the photoionization cross section, and $J_{\nu}$
% is the mean intensity. The corresponding recombination rate is given
% by 
% \begin{equation}
% {\cal R}_{\kappa l} = \alpha_{\kappa l} n_{\kappa} n_e + C_{\kappa l}
% n_\kappa n_e, \\
% \end{equation}
% where $\alpha_{\kappa l}$ is the radiative recombination coefficient
% to level $l$. This treatment means that radiative and collisional
% rates to and from all levels are considered when calculating both the
% ionization state and the level populations, although we neglect 
% ionization directly to excited levels of the upper ion. The
% \cite{vanregemorter} approximation is used for collisional
% transitions. This means that collisions between radiatively
% forbidden transitions are not taken into account when one 
% splits levels into $l$- and $s$-subshells, as well
% as principal quantum number, $n$ (as we have done with He~\textsc{i}; 
% see section~\ref{sec:data}). Although this approximation is, in general, 
% a poor one, the effect is second order in the physical 
% regime where recombination lines are formed in our models. 
% This is because bound-free processes are dominant in determining 
% level populations and emissivities. We have verified that this 
% is indeed the case in the He~\textsc{i} emission regions in our models.

% \subsection{Ionization and Excitation: A Hybrid Approach}

% SDL05 implemented a macro-atom treatment of H in \py\ and used
% this to predict the observable properties of a pure H wind
% model for YSOs. Our goal here is to simultaneously model the optical
% and ultraviolet spectra of high-state CVs. Since the optical spectra
% are dominated by H and He recombination lines, both of these species
% need to be treated as macro-atoms. The UV spectra, on the other hand,
% are dominated by resonance lines associated with metals. This means we
% need to include these species in our models, but they can be treated 
% with our (much faster) simple-atom approach. We have therefore
% implemented a hybrid ionization and excitation scheme into \py. Any
% atomic species can now be treated either in our simple-atom
% approximation or with the full macro-atom machinery. In our CV
% models, we treat H and He as macro-atoms and all metals as
% simple-atoms. Species treated with either method
% are fully taken into account as sources of both bound-free opacity and line opacity, 
% and contribute to the heating and cooling balance of the plasma.

% \subsection{Atomic Data}
% \label{sec:data}

% We generally use the same atomic data as H13, which is an updated
% version of that described by LK02. In addition, we follow SDL05 in
% treating H as a 20-level atom, where each level is defined by
% the principal quantum number, $n$. For the macro-atom treatment of
% He, we have added the additional level and line information required 
% from \textsc{Topbase} \citep{topbase2005}.  He~\textsc{ii} is treated
% in much the same way as H, but with 10 levels. He~\textsc{i} has
% larger energy differentials between different l-subshells and triplet
% and singlet states. Thus, we still include levels up to $n=10$, but
% explicitly treat the $l$ and $s$ sub-orbitals as distinct levels
% instead of assuming they are perfectly `l-mixed'. This allows us
% to model the singlet and  triplet He~\textsc{i} lines that are ubiquitous
% in the optical spectra of CVs \citep[e.g.][]{dhillon1996}.


% \subsection{Code Validation and Testing}

% \py\ has been tested against a number of radiative transfer and
% photoionization codes. LK02 and H13 conducted comparisons of 
% ionization balance  with \cld \citep{cloudy2013}, demonstrating
% excellent agreement. We have also carried out comparisons
% of ionization and spectral synthesis with the supernova code
% \textsc{Tardis.} \tar is described by 
% \cite{kerzendorfsim}, and the spectral comparisons can be found
% therein. For the effort reported here, we have additionally carried
% out tests of the macro-atom scheme in \py. Fig.~\ref{tests} shows
% two of these tests. In the top panel, we compare the Balmer series 
% emissivities as predicted by \py\ in the l-mixed Case~B limit against the
% analytical calculations by \cite{seaton1959}. In the bottom panel, we
% compare \py\ and \tar predictions of  He \textsc{i} level populations
% for a particular test case. Agreement is excellent for both H and He.

% %
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% \section{Describing the System and its Outflow}

% \py\ includes several different kinematic models of accretion disc
% winds, as well as different options for describing the physical and
% radiative properties of the wind-driving system under
% consideration. Most of these features have already been discussed by
% LK02 and H13, so below we only briefly recount the key aspects of the
% particular system and wind model used in the present study.

% \subsection{Wind Geometry and Kinematics}
% \label{kinematics}

% We adopt the kinematic disc wind model developed by SV93. 
% A schematic of this model is shown in
% Fig.~\ref{cartoon}. In this parametrization, a smooth, biconical
% disc wind emanates from the accretion disc between radii $r_{min}$ and 
% $r_{max}$. The covering fraction of the outflow is also controlled by the
% inner and outer opening angles of the wind, $\theta_{min}$ and
% $\theta_{max}$, and the launch angle of the other streamlines is given
% by 
% \begin{equation}
% \theta(r_0) = \theta_{min} + (\theta_{max} - \theta_{min}) \left(\frac{r_0 - r_{min}}{r_{max} - r_{min}} \right)^{\gamma},
% \label{theta}
% \end{equation}
% where $r_0$ is the launch radius of the streamline.

% The poloidal (non-rotational) velocity field of the wind, $v_l$, is given by
% \begin{equation}
% v_l=v_0+\left[v_{\infty}(r_0)-v_0\right]\frac{\left(l/R_v\right)^{\alpha}}{\left(l/R_v\right)^{\alpha}+1},
% \label{v_law}
% \end{equation}
% where $l$ is the poloidal distance along a particular wind
% streamline. The terminal velocity along a streamline, $v_{\infty}$, is
% set to a fixed multiple of $v_{esc}$, the escape velocity at the launch
% point. The launch velocity from the disc surface, $v_0$, is assumed to
% be constant (set to $6$~km~s$^{-1}$). Once the wind is launched, it
% accelerates, reaching half of its terminal velocity at $l = R_v$. The
% velocity law exponent $\alpha$ controls how quickly the wind
% accelerates. Larger values of $\alpha$ cause the main region of 
% acceleration to occur close to $R_v$, whereas smaller values
% correspond to fast acceleration close to the disc (see
% Fig.~\ref{acc_law}). The rotational velocity $v_\phi$ is 
% Keplerian at the base of the streamline 
% and we assume conservation of specific angular momentum,
% such that
% \begin{equation}
% v_\phi r = v_{k} r_0,
% \label{v_law}
% \end{equation}
% where $v_{k}=(GM_{WD}/r_0)^{1/2}$.

% \begin{figure}
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/05-cvpaper/acc_law.eps}
% \caption{
% The adopted poloidal velocity law for various values of the
% acceleration exponent, $\alpha$.
% %%{\bf JM: KSL has suggested we ditch this}
% } 
% \label{acc_law}
% \end{figure}

% The density at position $(r,z)$ in the wind, $\rho(r,z)$, is
% calculated from the mass continuity equation, yielding
% \begin{equation}
% \rho(r,z) = \frac{r_0}{r} \frac{dr_0}{dr} \frac{\phi(r_0)}{v_z(r,z)}.
% \label{density}
% \end{equation}
% Here, 
% $v_z$ is the vertical velocity component and, following SV93,
% $\phi(r_0)$ is the local mass-loss rate per unit area at $r_0$, 
% defined as
% \begin{equation}
% \phi(r_0) \propto \dot{M}_{wind} r_0^\lambda \cos [\theta(r_0)].
% \label{density}
% \end{equation}
% We adopt $\lambda = 0$ and normalize $\phi(r_0)$ by 
% matching its integral over both sides of the disc
% to the user-specified total mass-loss rate, $\dot{M}_{wind}$. 


\subsection{Sources and Sinks of Radiation}
\label{radsources}

\begin{figure} 
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/05-cvpaper/fig2_cartoon.png}
\caption{Cartoon illustrating the geometry and kinematics of the benchmark CV wind model.}
\label{cartoon}
\end{figure} 

The net photon sources in our CV model are the accretion disc, the
WD and, in principle, a boundary layer with user-defined temperature
and luminosity. All of these radiating bodies are taken to be
optically thick, and photons striking them are assumed to be destroyed
instantaneously. The secondary star is not included as a radiation
source, but is included as an occulting body. This allows us to model
eclipses. Finally, emission from the wind itself is also accounted for, but
note that we assume the outflow to be in radiative equilibrium. Thus all
of the heating of the wind, as well as its emission, is ultimately
powered by the radiation field of the net photon sources in the
simulation. In the following sections, we will describe our treatment
of these system components in slightly more detail.

\subsubsection{Accretion disc}

\py\ has some flexibility when treating the accretion 
disc as a source of photons. The disc is broken down into annuli 
such that each annulus contributes an equal amount to the bolometric
luminosity. We take the disc to be geometrically thin, but optically
thick, and thus adopt the temperature profile of a standard
\cite{shakurasunyaev1973} $\alpha$-disc. An annulus can then
be treated either as a blackbody with the corresponding effective
temperature or as a stellar atmosphere model with the appropriate
surface gravity and effective temperature. Here, we use blackbodies 
during the ionization cycles and to compute our Monte Carlo
estimators. However, during the spectral synthesis stage of the 
simulation we use stellar atmosphere models. This produces more
realistic model spectra and allows us to test if recombination
emission from the wind base can fill in the Balmer jump, which is
always in absorption in these models. Our synthetic stellar atmosphere
spectra are calculated with
\textsc{Synspec}\footnote{http://nova.astro.umd.edu/Synspec43/synspec.html}
from either Kurucz \citep{kurucz1991} atmospheres (for $T_{eff} \leq
50,000$~K) or from \textsc{TLUSTY} \citep{tlusty} models (for $T_{eff} > 50,000$~K). 

\subsubsection{White Dwarf}

The WD at the center of the disc is always present as a spherical occulting
body with radius $R_{WD}$ in \py\ CV models, but it can also be included
as a source of radiation. In the models presented here, we treat the
WD as a blackbody radiator with temperature $T_{WD}$ and luminosity
$L_{WD} = 4\pi R_{WD}^2 \sigma T_{WD}^4$. 

\subsubsection{Boundary Layer}

It is possible to include radiation from a boundary layer (BL) between
the disc and the WD. In \py, the BL is described as
a blackbody with a user-specified effective temperature and
luminosity. In the models presented here, we have followed LK02 in setting
the BL luminosity to zero. However, we have confirmed that the addition of an isotropic
BL with $L_{BL} = 0.5 L_{acc}$ and temperatures in the range $80~{\rm
kK} \leq T_{BL} \leq 200~{\rm kK}$ would not change any of our main
conclusions. 

\subsubsection{Secondary Star}

The donor star is included in the system as a pure radiation sink, 
i.e. it does not emit photons, but absorbs any photons that strike its
surface. The secondary is assumed to be Roche-lobe filling, so its
shape and relative size are defined by setting the mass ratio of the system, 
$q = M_2/M_{WD}$. The inclusion of the donor star as an occulting body
allows us to model eclipses of the disc and the wind. For this
purpose, we assume a circular orbit with a semi-major axis $a$ and 
specify orbital phase such that $\Phi_{orb} = 0$ is the
inferior conjunction of the secondary (i.e. mid-eclipse for $i \simeq
90^o$).

\section{A Benchmark disc Wind Model}
\label{modela}

Our main goal is to test whether the type of disc wind model that has
been successful in explaining the UV spectra of CVs could also have a
significant impact on the optical continuum and emission line spectra
of these systems. In order to set a benchmark, we therefore begin by
investigating one of the fiducial CV wind models that was used by SV93
and LK02 to simulate the UV spectrum of a typical high-state
system. The specific parameters for this model (model A) are listed in
Table~1. A key point is that the wind mass-loss rate in this model is
set to 10$\%$ of the accretion rate through the disc. We follow SV93
in setting the inner edge of the wind ($r_{min}$) to $4~R_{WD}$. 
The sensitivity to some of these parameters is briefly discussed in
section~5. 

\subsection{Physical Structure and Ionization State}
\label{modela_ionization}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/05-cvpaper/fig5.eps}
\caption{
The physical properties of the wind -- note the logarithmic scale. 
Near the disc plane the wind is dense, with low poloidal velocities.
As the wind accelerates it becomes less dense
and more highly ionized. The dominant He ion
is almost always He III, apart from in a small
portion of the wind at the base, which is partially shielded
from the inner disc.
}
\label{wind}
\end{figure*}

Fig.~\ref{wind} shows the physical and ionization structure 
of the benchmark disc wind model. The ionization parameter shown in the bottom
right panel is given by

\begin{equation}
U = \frac{4\pi}{n_H c}\int_{13.6{\rm{eV}}}^{\infty}\frac{{J_{\nu}d\nu}}{h\nu},
\end{equation}
 
\noindent where $\rm{n_H}$ is the local number density of H, and $\nu$ denotes photon 
frequency. The ionization parameter is a useful measure of the ionization state of a plasma, 
as it evaluates the ratio of the number density of ionizing photons to the local 
H density.


There is an obvious drop-off in density
and temperature with distance away from the disc, so any line
formation process that scales as $\rho^2$ -- i.e. recombination and
collisionally excited emission -- should be expected to operate
primarily in the dense base of the outflow. Moreover, a comparison of
the rotational and poloidal velocity fields shows that rotation
dominates in the near-disc regime, while outflow dominates further out
in the wind. 

The ionization equation used in the `simple atom' approach used by
LK02 (see section~\ref{simpleatoms}) should be a reasonable approximation to
the photoionization equilibrium in the benchmark wind model. Even
though the macro-atom treatment of H and He does affect the 
computation of the overall ionization equilibrium, we would expect the
resulting ionization state of the wind to be quite similar to that
found by LK02. The bottom panels in Fig.~\ref{wind} confirm that this
is the case. In particular, He is fully ionized
throughout most of the outflow, except for a small region near the
base of the wind, which is shielded from the photons produced by the
hot inner disc. In line with the results of LK02, we also find
that C\textsc{iv} is the dominant C ion throughout the wind,
resulting in a substantial absorbing column across a large range of
velocities. As we shall see, this produces the broad, deep and
blue-shifted C\textsc{iv}~$\lambda1550$ absorption line that
is usually the most prominent wind-formed feature in the UV spectra of
low-inclination nova-like CVs.

\heiiuv\ and \ha. Double-peaked line emission can be seen in 
\heiiuv, \heiiopt, \ha\ and some He I lines, but the 
line emission is not always sufficient to overcome the absorption
cores from the stellar atmosphere models. The model
also produces a prominent \heiioptnew\ line at high inclinations.
}
\label{spec}
\end{figure*}



\subsection{Synthetic Spectra}
\label{modela_spectrum}

We begin by verifying that the benchmark model still produces UV
spectra that resemble those observed in CVs. We do expect this to be
the case, since the ionization state of the wind has not changed
significantly from that computed by LK02 (see section~\ref{modela_ionization}). 
The left column of panels in Fig.~\ref{spec} shows that this expectation
is met: all of the strong metal resonance
lines -- notably N~\textsc{v}~$\lambda1240$,
Si~\textsc{iv}~$\lambda1400$ and C~\textsc{iv}~$\lambda1550$ -- 
are present and exhibit clear P-Cygni profiles
at intermediate inclinations. In addition, however, we now also find
that the wind produces significant Ly$\alpha$ and
He~\textsc{ii}~$\lambda1640$ emission lines. 

Fig.~\ref{spec} (right-hand panel) and Fig.~\ref{spec_continuum}
show the corresponding optical spectra produced for
the benchmark model, and these do exhibit some emission lines
associated with H and He. We see a general trend from absorption lines to emission lines 
with increasing inclination, as one might expect from our wind
geometry. This trend is consistent with observations, as can be seen
in Fig.~1. However, it is clear that this particular model
does not produce all of the lines seen in observations of high-state CVs.
The higher-order Balmer series lines are too weak
to overcome the intrinsic absorption from the disc atmosphere, and the wind 
fails to produce any observable emission at low and intermediate inclinations.
This contrasts with the fact that emission lines are seen 
in the optical spectra of (for example) V3885 Sgr \citep{hartley2005}
and IX Vel \citep[][see also Fig.~1]{beuermann1990}.

The emissivity of these recombination 
features scales as $\rho^2$, meaning that they form almost entirely in the 
dense base of the wind, just above the accretion disc. Here, the
velocity field of the wind is still dominated by rotation, rather than
outflow, which accounts for the double-peaked shape of the lines. In
principle, lines formed in this region can still be single peaked,
since the existence of a poloidal velocity {\em gradient} changes the
local escape probabilities (MC96). However, as
discussed further in section~5.3, the 
radial velocity shear in our
models is not high enough for this radiative transfer effect
to dominate the line shapes.

The Balmer jump is in absorption at all inclinations for our benchmark
model. This is due to the stellar atmospheres we have used to
model the disc spectrum; it is not a result of photoabsorption in the
wind. In fact, the wind spectrum exhibits the Balmer jump in {\em
emission}, but this is not strong enough to overcome the intrinsic
absorption edge in the disc spectrum. This is illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{cont}, which shows the angle-integrated spectrum of the system,
i.e. the spectrum formed by all escaping photons, separated into the
disc and wind contributions. Even though the wind-formed Balmer
recombination continuum does not completely fill in the Balmer
absorption edge in this model, it does already contribute
significantly to the total spectrum. This suggests that modest changes 
to the outflow kinematics might boost the wind continuum and produce
emergent spectra with weak or absent Balmer absorption edges.

\section{A Revised Model Optimized for Optical Wavelengths}

The benchmark model discussed in section~\ref{modela} was originally
designed to reproduce the wind-formed lines seen in the UV spectra of
high-state CVs. As we have seen, this model does produce some observable
optical emission. We can now attempt to construct a model that more closely 
matches the observed optical spectra of CVs. 

Specifically, we aim to assess whether a revised model can:

\begin{itemize}
         \item account for all of the lines we see in optical spectra of CVs while preserving
the UV behaviour;
         \item produce single-peaked Balmer emission lines; 
         \item generate enough of a wind-formed recombination continuum
to completely fill in the disc's Balmer absorption edge for 
reasonable outflow parameters.
\end{itemize} 

The emission measure of a plasma is directly proportional to its density.
The simplest way to simultaneously affect the density in the wind (for fixed mass-loss rate),
as well as the velocity gradients, is by modifying the poloidal velocity
law. Therefore, we focus on just two kinematic variables (section~\ref{kinematics}):

\begin{itemize}
         \item the acceleration length, $R_v$, which controls the
        distance over which the wind accelerates to $\frac{1}{2}~v_{\infty}$;
         \item the acceleration exponent, $\alpha$, which controls the rate 
         at which the poloidal velocity changes near $R_v$.
\end{itemize} 

The general behaviour we might expect is that outflows with denser
regions near the wind base -- i.e. winds with larger $R_{v}$ and/or
larger $\alpha$ -- will produce stronger optical emission signatures. 
However, this behaviour may be moderated by the effect of the increasing
optical depth through this region, which can also affect the line profile shapes. 
In addition, modifying $R_v$ also increases the emission {\em volume}.
Based on a preliminary exploration of models with different kinematics,
we adopt the parameters listed in table~\ref{modelb_table}
for our `optically optimized' model (model B). 

%It is possible that other parameters, such as the launching radii and angles



\subsection{Synthetic Spectra}

\heiiuv\ and \ha. The Balmer and He
are double-peaked, albeit with narrower profiles.

of a deeper Balmer jump with decreasing inclination.
}
\label{uvoptb}
\end{figure*}

Fig.~\ref{uvoptb} shows the UV and optical spectra for the
optically optimized model for the full range of inclinations. 
As expected, the trend from absorption to emission 
in the optical is again present, but in this revised model we produce emission
lines in the entire Balmer series at high inclinations, as well as the observed lines 
in He~\textsc{ii} and He~\textsc{i}. This can be seen more clearly in the 
continuum-normalized spectrum in Fig.~\ref{continuumb}.

Two other features are worth noting in the optical
spectrum. First, the collisionally excited Ca~{\sc ii} emission line at 3934~\AA\ 
becomes quite prominent in our densest models. Second, our model predicts a detectable
He~\textsc{ii} recombination line at 3202~\AA. This is the He
equivalent of Paschen~$\beta$ and should be expected in all systems that
feature a strong He~\textsc{ii}~$\lambda4686$ line (the He
equivalent of Paschen~$\alpha$). 
This line is somewhat unfamiliar observationally, because it 
lies bluewards of the atmospheric cut-off, but
also redwards of most ultraviolet spectra. 

Our models do not exhibit P-Cygni profiles in the optical lines.
This is perhaps not surprising. LK02 and SV93 originally designed such models
to reproduce the UV line profiles. Thus, most of the wind
has an ionization parameter of $\log U \sim 2$ (see Fig.~\ref{wind}).
This means H and He are fully ionized throughout 
much of the wind and are successful in producing recombination features.
However, the line opacity throughout the wind is too
low to produce noticeable blue shifted absorption. 
We suspect that the systems that exhibit such profiles must 
possess a higher degree of ionization stratification, although the lack 
of contemporary observations means it is not known for certain if the 
P-Cygni profiles in UV resonance lines and optical H and He lines exist simultaneously.
Ionization stratification could be caused by a clumpy flow, in which the ionization state 
changes due to small scale density fluctuations, or a stratification in density
and ionizing radiation field over larger scales.
Invoking clumpiness in these outflows is not an unreasonable
hypothesis. Theories of line-driven winds predict an unstable flow
\citep{macgregor1979,owockirybicki1984,owockirybicki1985}, and
simulations of CV disc winds also produce density inhomogeneities 
\citep{proga1998,pkdh2002}.
Tentative evidence for clumping being directly related to P-Cygni optical lines
comes from the fact that \cite{prinja2000}
found the dwarf nova BZ Cam's outflow to be unsteady and highly mass-loaded in outburst,
based on observations of the UV resonance lines.
This system has also exhibited P-Cygni profiles in He~\textsc{i}~$\lambda5876$
and \ha\ when in a high-state \citep{patterson1996,RN98}. 
The degree of ionization and density variation and 
subsequent line opacities may be affected by our model parameters
and the specific parameterisation we have adopted.

In the UV, the model still produces all the observed lines, 
and deep P-Cygni profiles are produced in the normal resonance lines,
as discussed in section 4.2. However, the UV spectra also
display what is perhaps the biggest problem with this revised model,
namely the strength of resonance line emission 
at low and intermediate inclinations.
In order to generate strong optical wind signatures, we have adopted wind
parameters that lead to very high densities at the base of the wind
($n_e\sim10^{13}-10^{14}$~cm$^{-3}$). This produces
the desired optical recombination emission, but also increases the
role of collisional excitation in the formation of the UV resonance
lines. This explains the pronounced increase in the emission component 
of the C\textsc{iv} $\lambda1550$ resonance line, for example, relative to
what was seen in the benchmark model (compare Figures~\ref{spec} and
\ref{uvoptb}). The strength of this component in the revised model 
is probably somewhat too high to be consistent with UV observations 
of high-state CVs (see e.g. Long et al. 1991, 1994; Noebauer et al. 2010).
\nocite{long1991,long1994, noebauer}


\subsection{Continuum Shape and the Balmer Jump}

The wind now also has a clear effect on the continuum shape,
as shown by Fig.~\ref{modelb_escape}. In fact, the majority of the
escaping spectrum has been reprocessed in some way by the wind,
either by electron scattering (the wind is now moderately Thomson-thick),
or by bound-free processes. This is demonstrated by the flatter spectral shape
and the slight He photoabsorption edge present in the optical spectrum 
(marked in Fig.~\ref{continuumb}). This reprocessing is also
responsible for the change in continuum level between models A and B.
In addition, Figures~\ref{uvoptb}, \ref{continuumb} 
and \ref{modelb_escape} clearly demonstrate that the wind produces
a recombination continuum sufficient to completely fill in the Balmer jump
at high inclinations.\footnote{Note that the apparent absorption feature 
just redward of the Balmer jump in these models is artificial. It is
caused by residual line blanketing in the stellar atmospheres, which
our models cannot fill in since they employ a 20-level H atom.}
This might suggest that Balmer continuum emission from a wind can be important 
in shaping the Balmer jump region, as
originally suggested by Knigge et al.
(1998b; see also Hassall et al. 1985)\nocite{KLWB98,hassall}. 

It should be acknowledged, however,
that the Balmer jump in high-state CVs would naturally weaken at
high inclinations due to limb darkening effects \citep{ladous1989, ladous1989b}. 
Although we include a simple limb darkening law which affects 
the emergent flux at each inclination, we do not
include it as a {\em frequency dependent} opacity in our model.
As a result, the efficiency of filling in the Balmer jump
should really be judged at low and medium inclinations, 
where, although prominent, the recombination continuum does
not overcome the disc atmosphere absorption. 
In addition, this effect 
could mean that any model which successfully fills in the 
jump at low inclinations could lead to a Balmer jump 
in emission at high inclinations.
In any case, to properly understand this phenomenon, a fully self-consistent
radiative transfer calculation of both the disc atmosphere
and connected wind is required.

\subsection{Line Profile Shapes: Producing Single-Peaked Emission}


Fig.~\ref{halpha} shows how the H$\alpha$ profile changes with the kinematics of the wind for 
an inclination of $80^\circ$. The main prediction is that dense, slowly accelerating 
wind models produce narrower emission lines. This is {\em not} due to radial 
velocity shear. As stated by MC96, that mechanism can only work if poloidal 
and rotational velocity gradients satisfy $(dv_l/dr)/(dv_\phi/dr) \gtrsim 1$; in 
our models, this ratio is always $\lesssim 0.1$. Instead, the narrow lines predicted 
by our denser wind models can be traced to the base of the outflow becoming optically 
thick in the continuum, such that the line emission from the base of the wind
cannot escape to the observer. In such models, the `line photosphere'
(the $\tau \simeq 1$ surface of the line-forming region) moves outwards, towards larger 
vertical and cylindrical distances. This reduces the predicted line widths, since the 
rotational velocities -- which normally provide the main line broadening mechanism at 
high inclination -- drop off as $1/r$. This is not to say that the MC96 
mechanism could not be at work in CV winds. For example, it would be worth investigating
alternative prescriptions for the wind velocity field, as well as the possibility that the 
outflows may be clumped. An inhomogeneous flow 
(which has been predicted in CVs; see section 5.2)
might allow large radial velocity shears to exist while still 
maintaining the high densities needed to produce the required level of emission.
However, such an investigation is beyond the scope of the present paper.

In our models, single-peaked line profiles are produced once the line forming region has been
pushed up to $\sim 10^{11}$~cm ($\sim150~R_{WD}$) above the disc plane. 
This number may seem unrealistically large, but the vertical extent of 
the emission region is actually not well constrained observationally. 
In fact, multiple observations of eclipsing NLs show that the H$\alpha$ 
line is only moderately eclipsed compared to the continuum (e.g. Baptista et al. 2000;
Groot et al. 2004; see also section 5.4), 
implying a significant vertical extent for the line-forming 
region. This type of model should therefore not be ruled out {\em a priori}, 
but this specific model was not adopted as our optically optimized model
due to its unrealistically high continuum level in eclipse. 

\subsection{Sensitivity to Model Parameters}

This revised model demonstrates that one can achieve a more
realistic optical spectrum by altering just two kinematic parameters. 
However, it may also be possible to achieve this by modifying
other free parameters such as $\dot{M}_{wind}$, the opening angles of the wind and the 
inner and outer launch radii. For example, increasing the mass-loss rate of the wind
increases the amount of recombination emission (which scales as $\rho^2$), 
as well as lowering the ionization parameter and increasing the optical depth through the wind. 
Larger launching regions and covering factors tend to lead to a larger emitting volume, 
but this is moderated by a decrease in density 
for a fixed mass-loss rate. We also note that the inner radius of $4~R_{WD}$ adopted by SV93 
affects the emergent UV spectrum seen at inclinations $<\theta_{min}$ as 
the inner disc is uncovered. This causes less absorption in the UV resonance lines,
but the effect on the optical spectrum is negligible.
We have verified this general behaviour, but
we suggest that future work should investigate the effect of these parameters in more detail,
as well as incorporating a treatment of clumping.
If a wind really does produce the line and continuum emission seen in optical spectra of high-state CVs, then
understanding the true mass-loss rate and geometry of the outflow is clearly important.


\subsection{Comparison to RW Tri}

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/05-cvpaper/fig13.png}
\caption{{\sl Top Panel:} In and out of eclipse spectra of the high
inclination NL RW Tri. {\sl Bottom Panel:} In and out of eclipse synthetic
spectra from model B.

is caused for the reasons described in section 5.2.}
\label{rwtricomp}
\end{figure*}

Fig.~\ref{rwtricomp} shows a comparison of the predicted
out-of-eclipse and mid-eclipse spectra against observations of the
high-inclination nova-like RW~Tri. The inclination of RW Tri is
somewhat uncertain, with estimates including $70.5^\circ$
\citep{smak1995}, $75^\circ$ \citep{groot2004}, $80^\circ$
\citep{longmore1981} and $82^\circ$\citep{frankking1981}. Here, we
adopt $i = 80^\circ$, but our qualitative conclusions are not
particularly sensitive to this choice. 
We follow LK02 is setting the value of $r_{disc}$ (the maximum radius of the accretion disc)
to $34.3~R_{WD}$. When compared to the semi-major axis of RW Tri,
this value is perhaps lower than one might 
typically expect for NLs \citep{harropallinwarner1996}. 
However, it is consistent
with values inferred by \cite{rutten1992}.
We emphasize that this model is in no sense a fit to this -- or any other -- data set.


The similarity between the synthetic and observed spectra is
striking. In particular, the revised model produces strong emission in
all the Balmer lines, with line-to-continuum ratios comparable to
those seen in RW Tri. Moreover, the line-to-continuum contrast
increases during eclipse, as expected for emission produced in a disc
wind. This trend is in line with the observations of RW~Tri, and it
has also been seen in other NLs, including members of the SW~Sex class
\citep{neustroev2011}. As noted in section 5.2, the majority
of the escaping radiation has been reprocessed by the wind in some way
(particularly the eclipsed light).

However, there are also interesting differences between the revised
model and the RW Tri data set. For example, the model exhibits
considerably stronger He~{\sc ii} features than the observations,
which suggests that the overall ionization state of the model is
somewhat too high. As discussed in section 5.3, the optical lines are
narrow, but double-peaked. This is in contrast to what is generally seen in observations
of NLs, although the relatively low resolution of the RW Tri
spectrum makes a specific comparison difficult. In order to demonstrate
the double-peaked nature of the narrower lines, we choose not to 
smooth the synthesized data to the resolution of the RW Tri dataset.
If the data was smoothed, the \ha\ line would appear single-peaked.

\section{Conclusions}

We have investigated whether a disc wind model designed to reproduce
the UV spectra of high-state CVs would also have a significant effect
on the optical spectra of these systems. We find that this is indeed
the case. In particular, the model wind produces H and He
recombination lines, as well as a recombination continuum blueward of
the Balmer edge. We do not produce P-Cygni profiles
in the optical H and He lines, 
which are seen in a small fraction of CV optical spectra.
Possible reasons for this are briefly discussed in section 
5.2.

We have also constructed a revised benchmark model which is designed
to more closely match the optical spectra of high-state CVs. This
optically optimized model produces all the prominent optical lines in
and out of eclipse, and achieves reasonable verisimilitude with the
observed optical spectra of RW Tri. However, this model also has
significant shortcomings. In particular, it predicts
stronger-than-observed He~{\sc ii} lines in the optical region and too
much of a collisionally excited contribution to the UV resonance lines. 

Based on this, we argue that recombination emission 
from outflows with sufficiently high densities and/or optical depths 
might produce the optical lines observed in CVs, and may also 
fill in the Balmer absorption edge in the spectrum of the accretion disc, 
thus accounting for the absence of a strong edge in observed CV spectra.
In section 5.3, we demonstrate that
although the double peaked lines narrow and 
single-peaked emission can be formed in our densest models, 
this is not due to the radial velocity shear mechanism proposed by MC96.
We suggest that `clumpy' line-driven winds or a different
wind parameterization may nevertheless allow this mechanism to work.
We also note the possibility that, as in our denser models, 
the single-peaked lines are formed well above the disc, where 
rotational velocities are lower.

It is not yet clear whether a wind model such as this can
explain all of the observed optical features of high-state CVs --
further effort is required on both the observational
and modelling fronts.
However, our work demonstrates that {\sl disc winds matter}. They are
not just responsible for creating the blue-shifted absorption and
P-Cygni profiles seen in the UV resonance lines of high-state CVs, but
can also have a strong effect on the optical appearance of these
systems. In fact, most of the optical features characteristic of CVs
are likely to be affected -- and possibly even dominated -- by their disc
winds. Given that optical spectroscopy plays the central role in
observational studies of CVs, it is critical to know 
where and how these spectra are actually formed. We believe it is high
time for a renewed effort to understand the formation of spectra in
accretion discs and associated outflows.
